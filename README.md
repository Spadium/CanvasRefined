# Betterer Canvas

name idea: even better canvas or Actually Better Canvas (ABC)

I don't like the direction bettercanvas (bettercampus) is heading so I forked it

They tried to change license but forgot to wipe the codebase for thier MIT licensed version, so this is a fully legal fork.

Enhancements to Canvas AND bettercanvas like dark mode, better todo list, GPA calculator, and more!

## Contributing

### Add a new feature

To add a new feature, please follow these guidelines.

#### Identifier

- Should be a unqiue one/two word storage identifier to indicate its status. (ie "dark_mode" or "dashboard_grades")
- If it has sub options (options that are specific to the main feature) these will also each need a unique identifier.
- All options are synced and have a 8kb storage limit, so if your feature needs more than this please contact me.

#### Changes to html/popup.html

- Add the appropriate HTML into this file. The corresponding id and name (see below) should be the identifier.
- If it has no sub options, it should be put in the same container as the other options with no sub options:

```
<div class="option" id="<identifier>">
    <input type="radio" id="off" name="<identifier>">
    <input type="radio" id="on" name="<identifier>">
    <div class="slider">
        <div class="sliderknob"></div>
        <div class="sliderbg"></div>
    </div>
    <span class="option-name"><option name></span>
</div>
```

- If it does have sub options it becomes it's own container:

```
<div class="option-container">
  <div class="option" id="<identifier>">
    <input type="radio" id="off" name="<identifier>">
    <input type="radio" id="on" name="<identifier>">
    <div class="slider">
      <div class="sliderknob"></div>
      <div class="sliderbg"></div>
    </div>
    <span class="option-name"><option name></span>
  </div>
  <div class="sub-options">
    <div class="sub-option">
      <input type="checkbox" id="<sub identifier>" name="<sub identifier>">
      <label for="<sub identifier>" class="sub-text"><option name></label>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Changes to js/popup.js

- Add the main identifier into the `syncedSwitches` array.
- If you have sub-options:
  - Add these identifiers to the array found under the comment that says `//checkboxes`.

#### Changes to js/background.js

- Add all identifiers into the `syncedOptions` array.
- Add a default value for your option to the `default_options` array.
  - Preferably this value should be `false` for booleans or ` ""` for strings (`null` can also be used if Canvas has a default for this option already)

#### Changes to js/content.js

- There should be a function(s) included in the this file that does the work. The name should clearly indicate it's purpose.
- Under `applyOptionsChanges()`, add a switch case to call this function when the menu toggle is changed.
- Depending on what your feature does, it needs to be told when to fire.
  - If the function changes any aspect of the dashboard, it should be put inside `checkDashboardReady()`.
  - If the function only adds css, it should be added to `applyAestheticChanges()`, and in this case should not be a separate function, instead add the css to the existing styles found in this function.
  - Anything else should be put under `startExtension()` and should be placed no higher than the `checkDashboardReady` function found here.

### Add a new theme

To add a new theme, please follow these guidelines.

You can export a theme using the export tool in the menu and sending an email to me, or you can merge it here after doing the following:

#### Exporting

- Go to the Themes tab and export dark mode, card images, card colors, and custom font. - The only on/off toggles that need be included are `disable_color_overlay` and `gradient_cards`.
  Any other toggles aren't necessary, so you should manually add these keys and the appropriate values in with the export code.
- Pick a unique id for the theme, doesn't matter how long this is.

#### Changes to js/popup.js

- Add the export code under `getTheme()`.
  - Make sure it follows this format: `"theme-<id>: { "exports": {"..."}, "preview": "..." }`
- For the preivew, try to pick the smallest image size from the card images (under ~50kb is perfect), or you can find a smaller display image that isn't included in the card images.

#### Changes to html/popup.html

- Add the following under all the other theme buttons:

```
<button id="theme-<id>" class="theme-button customization-button"><theme name> by <you></button>
```

- The theme name should be one/two words so it doesn't take up too much space.
